This is my final project for mod 2. I made a simple tetris game. It has 9 shapes, a score and level counter, a controls list, and will display what shape is next.


I followed this tutorial to help me - "The Alternative Guide to Building Tetris with JavaScript - Video for the Ultra Begginer" by Code With Ania Kubow - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1JJfK09ujQ&t=2774s

I added 4 shapes:
- a backwards L
- a backwards Z
- a shape that resembles an equals sign
- and a shape that changes to a new shape every time it is rotated. I also added a new shape to this, which resembles a cross with no middle to increase the difficulty.

I added the levels section and the controls menu. I also changed the controls to W, A, S, D instead of the arrow keys.

I also made it faster for more fun.

Press start to begin playing!
